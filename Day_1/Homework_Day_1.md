Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are not a move toward decentralization; they are inherently centralized, controlled by central banks. While they might increase public familiarity with digital payments, potentially driving interest in digital assets, they could also hinder the adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies. CBDCs may lead to stricter regulations on other cryptos, especially if policies are designed to favor state-backed digital currencies.
